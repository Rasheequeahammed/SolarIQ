## Project Overview

**SolarIQ** is a predictive modeling project focused on monitoring solar panel health and identifying defects to maximize energy production and improve system reliability for a leading solar power generation company. This project aims to detect faults in solar panels to ensure stable grid operations and minimize downtime.

### Business Problem
Manual inspections often lead to undetected defects in solar panels, inverters, and sensors, which can cause a decrease in energy production and reliability.

### Business Objective
- Maximize energy production and system reliability through efficient defect detection.
- Ensure grid stability and minimize downtime.

### Success Criteria
- **Business Success**: Increase energy production by at least 10% and improve system reliability with a 20% reduction in downtime.
- **Machine Learning Success**: Achieve an accuracy of at least 95%.
- **Economic Success**: Reduce maintenance costs by 15% and increase return on investment (ROI) by 20%.
